Code
=====

The final interactive is composed in `Multics.fla`, a Flash CS5 project file.
`Multics.as` is the "theatrics" code. This is where the actions of the interactive are staged.
`Typewriter.as` contains the code for the stop-motion typewriter animation and utility code for driving the text reading and writing engine.
`ProgrammingGame.as` and `EmailGame.as` contain the two activities for the interactive.

Graphics
========

`Left Comp_2.flv` and `Right_Comp_2.flv` are specially compressed sequences of images. The left composition is all the stop motion positions of the fingers striking keys on the typewriter. The right composition contains the stop motion positions of the typewriter striking the paper.
`Typewriter Images.aep` contains the After Effects CS5 composition with the typewriter and hand images. It also has a mockup of the button layout.
In order for the typewriter to appear in front of the paper, green paper was used, then keyed out in After Effects.
The original photographs are not available in this repository.
